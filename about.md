## Who is Ophelia?
Ophelia is the tragic heroine of William Shakespeare's play, _Hamlet_. 
Act IV, Scene V of _Hamlet_, or "The Mad Scene" begins with the action _Enter Ophelia_. It's pretty good.

This is apropos of nothing in this site except the name "Ophelia" has some special meaning to me unrelated to any literary works.

## What is this site?
I'm not sure yet, but hey, I learned some Jekyll, so that's something!


I do have some motivation. Given that I have several different semi-related interests - some work-related, some not - that intersect in some odd ways, I thought it would be nice to store some notes, code, etc. that is isn't attached to any one particular line of effort.
